#About
_Tell Me_ is an iOS application which provides a user an ability to record and analyze a message. 
Very often the meaning of the message a user sends is not exactly what a reciever should hear. 
Therefore this application will evaluate the message and will allow the user to adjust it based on the emotional, social and language tones.
###Main features:
* **Record and recognize message**: app uses **IBM Watson Speech To Text Service** to recognize user recorded message. 
* **Analyze message**: app uses **IBM Watson Tone Analyzer Services**  to detect three types of tones from written text: emotions, social tendencies, and writing style.
* **Visualize results**: app uses **Charts podfile** to create _beautiful charts_.
* **Send, Save, Edit** : app provides ability to **send** message via email, **save** message for later use and **edit** for continuing analysis.
